## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- with Visual Studio Code Editor

### What I learned

I learned an uncommon CSS property while building this project

```css
img {
  mix-blend-mode: *-css-keyword-*;
}
```

what this property does is, give us the accessibility to blend the parent element background with the using element's content.

### Continued development

I never knew this property exists in CSS until one of my Frontend Mentor Community friends pointed that out. Until now whenever some blended effect had to be created in a project, I followed an ordinary element overlaying method. But thanks to this, it is less code & markup.
